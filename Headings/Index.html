        <h1>Bettles</h1>
        <h2>External morphology</h2>
        <h2>Head</h2>
        <p>The beetle head is typically large, heavily sclerotized, and has forward or downward-projecting mouthparts. Beetles usually have compound eyes, which can be highly adapted. For example, whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) have split eyes to see above and below water. Some Longhorn beetles, weevils, and fireflies have divided or notched eyes. Ocelli (simple eyes) are rare in adults but more common in larvae; when present in adults, they appear in certain species like carpet beetles, some rove beetles, and Derodontidae. The structure of compound eyes varies depending on whether the beetle is active during the day, night, or twilight.</p>
        <h2>Mouthparts</h2>
        <p>Beetles have chewing mouthparts similar to those of grasshoppers. Their mandibles are hard, often tooth-like structures that move sideways to **grasp, cut, or crush food or enemies. In some beetles, especially males, the mandibles are enlarged compared to females and can resemble large pincers. Surrounding the mouth are two pairs of appendages maxillary and labial palpi which help manipulate and move food into the mouth </p>
        <h2>Thorax</h2>
        <p>The beetle thorax has two main parts: the prothorax and the pterothorax (a fused mesothorax and metathorax). Unlike in many insects, the meso- and metathorax are fused but still flexible with the prothorax. The thorax, viewed from below, bears all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings. The abdomen is the body section behind the thorax. From above, beetles seem to have three body sections, but the middle section is actually just the pronotum, the front part of the thorax, while the rear thorax is hidden beneath the wings. The abdomen shows clearer segmentation.</p>
        <h2>Prothorax</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>The prothorax is the front segment of the beetle’s thorax. It supports the first pair of legs and is located just behind the head. From above, the visible part of the prothorax is called the pronotum, which is often a hard, protective plate. The prothorax is separate but flexibly connected to the fused middle and rear parts of the thorax (the pterothorax).</p>
        <h2>Pterohorax</h2>
        <p>The pterothorax is the part of the beetle’s thorax formed by the fusion of the mesothorax and metathorax (the middle and rear thoracic segments). It is located behind the prothorax and bears the second and third pairs of legs as well as both pairs of wings—the hardened forewings (elytra) and the membranous hindwings used for flight. Although fused, the pterothorax is flexibly connected to the prothorax.</p>
        <h2>Legs</h2>
        <p> Beetle legs have multiple segments ending in 2 to 5 tarsi, usually with a pair of claws on the last segment. While mainly used for walking, legs are adapted for various functions: aquatic beetles (like diving beetles) have swimming legs with long hairs, and males use suctorial cups to grasp females. Some beetles have fossorial (digging) legs that are widened and spined, seen in scarabs and ground beetles. Others, like flea beetles and flea weevils, have enlarged hind femurs for jumping.</p>
        <h2>Wings</h2>
        <p>Beetle forewings are hardened into protective covers called elytra, which shield the hindwings and body. The elytra must be lifted for flight, except in some beetles like soldier beetles (Cantharidae), whose soft elytra earn them the name "leatherwings." Flight wings are veined, fold under the elytra, and feature a characteristic membrane fold at the base.
            Some beetles have lost the ability to fly, with fused elytra forming a solid shield, especially in certain ground beetles, weevils, and cave or desert species. In some families, like glow-worms, both wings and elytra are absent. However, having wings and elytra doesn’t always mean a beetle will fly—for example, the tansy beetle prefers walking between habitats despite being able to fly.</p>
        <h2>Abdomen</h2>
        <p>The abdomen is located behind the metathorax and consists of segmented rings, each with a breathing hole called a spiracle. It has three main parts: the tergum (usually soft and hidden under wings), the pleura (small or hidden sides, each with one spiracle), and the sternum (the most visible, hardened underside). The abdomen generally lacks appendages, though some beetles like Mordellidae have movable sternal lobes.</p>
