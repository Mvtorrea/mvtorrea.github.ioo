            <p>The seaside is my favorite place in the summer because I’ve always gone there with 
                my family and friends. We spend the days swimming, relaxing on the sand, and 
                enjoying the warm weather together. One of my favorite memories is celebrating the 
                4th of July there every year, watching fireworks over the water and feeling the cool 
                ocean breeze. Being at the seaside makes me feel happy and connected to the 
                people I care about, which is why it’s so special to me.</p>
