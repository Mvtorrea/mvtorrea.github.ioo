    <p>My favorite thing is travel.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing to do is travel because it lets me explore new places and learn about different cultures. I love seeing new landscapes, trying new foods, and meeting people from different backgrounds. Traveling makes me feel excited and curious, and every trip gives me memories I never forget. Whether it’s a long vacation or just a short weekend trip, traveling always makes me feel happy and inspired.</p>
